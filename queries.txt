1. Query to retrieve all domains and their associated skills
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (d:Domain)-[:CONTAINS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
RETURN d.name AS Domain, collect(s.name) AS Skills

2. Query to retrieve all professions and their required domains
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Profession)-[:REQUIRES_DOMAIN]->(d:Domain)
RETURN p.name AS Profession, collect(d.name) AS Domains

3. Query to retrieve all professions and their required skills
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Profession)-[:REQUIRES_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
RETURN p.name AS Profession, collect(s.name) AS Skills

4. Query to retrieve all related professions for a given profession
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Profession {name: $profession})-[:RELATED_TO]->(r:Profession)
RETURN r.name AS RelatedProfession

5. Query to retrieve all skills for a given user
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (u:User {name: $user_name})-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
RETURN s.name AS Skill

6. Query to find users who have a specific skill
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (u:User)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill {name: $skill_name})
RETURN u.name AS User
Replace $skill_name with the skill you're querying for.

7. Query to find professions that require a specific skill
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Profession)-[:REQUIRES_SKILL]->(s:Skill {name: $skill_name})
RETURN p.name AS Profession
Replace $skill_name with the skill you're interested in.

8. Query to retrieve all professions and related professions with required skills
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (p:Profession)-[:REQUIRES_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:RELATED_TO]->(r:Profession)
RETURN p.name AS Profession, collect(s.name) AS Skills, collect(r.name) AS RelatedProfessions

9. Query to find the closest profession for a user based on cosine similarity (calculating similarity would typically require external processing, but this is a conceptual query to get the data for similarity calculation):
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (u:User {name: $user_name})-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
WITH u, collect(s.name) AS user_skills
MATCH (p:Profession)-[:REQUIRES_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
WITH p, collect(s.name) AS profession_skills, user_skills
WHERE size(user_skills) > 0 AND size(profession_skills) > 0
RETURN p.name AS Profession, gds.similarity.cosine(user_skills, profession_skills) AS CosineSimilarity
ORDER BY CosineSimilarity DESC
LIMIT 1
Note: This query assumes you're using a graph data science library like Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) for calculating the cosine similarity. The actual cosine similarity computation would likely be done outside of Neo4j for more flexibility and efficiency in this specific context.

10. Query to find all professions within a specific domain
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (d:Domain {name: $domain})<-[:REQUIRES_DOMAIN]-(p:Profession)
RETURN p.name AS Profession
Replace $domain with the domain you're querying for.

11. Query to list all skills in a specific domain
cypher
Copy code
MATCH (d:Domain {name: $domain})-[:CONTAINS_SKILL]->(s:Skill)
RETURN s.name AS Skill
